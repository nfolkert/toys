  <p><b>Intro:</b></p>

  <p>Hi everybody i’m zoe’s dad and we’re going to talk about computers today. A computer is a machine that listens
    to and follows instructions. I’m a computer programmer, which means that I write the instructions for the computer
    to follow. It’s harder than it sounds because computers only understand a few instructions, so if you want it to
    do what you want, you have to tell it a lot of instructions. If you give the computer instructions that don’t
    make sense, or that it doesn’t understand, the computer can break, and you have to start it all over! Luckily
    it can follow instructions very very quickly! If you give the computer a lot of instructions it can draw a
    picture or make a sound. And if you give it a lot of instructions to draw pictures and make sounds it can
    even make a video game.</p>

  <p><b>Following Instructions Game:</b></p>

  <p>(In a circle) So now we’re going to pretend to be robots. Since robots have computers for brains, they
    follow instructions. But you guys are pretty smart robots so you understand a lot of different instructions.
    The only thing is that you only understand them if they start with “Hey Robot!”. So if I say “Hey Robot! Jump
    up and down”, because you’re a robot you can follow the instruction. But if I just say “Jump up and down”, you
    have to say “DOES NOT COMPUTE!”. If I catch you accidentally following an instruction that you don’t
    understand, or if you don’t say “DOES NOT COMPUTE!” then you have to restart your computer brain by running
    around the circle back to your place.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Hey Robot, jump up and down
    <li> Hey Robot, touch your toes
    <li> Hey Robot, put your hands on your head
    <li> Put your hands on your knees (DOES NOT COMPUTE)
    <li> Hey Robot, sit down with legs out
    <li> Hey Robot, stand up
    <li> Hey Robot, sit down with legs crossed
    <li> Stand up (DOES NOT COMPUTE)
    <li> Lay down (DOES NOT COMPUTE)
    <li> Hey Robot, jump all the way up
    <li> Hey Robot, do a robot dance
    <li> Say DOES NOT COMPUTE (DOES NOT COMPUTE!!!!)
  </ol>

  <p><b>Giving Instructions Game:</b></p>

  <p>(In a circle, put a box in one place and a chair in another then go stand in a third place) Now it’s
    your turn to tell a robot what to do. And I am the robot. But I’m not as smart a robot as you were. I
    only know FOUR instructions: step forward, turn right, pick up, and put down (you don’t need to say “Hey
    Robot”). The job you want me to do is to move that very heavy box over there to the chair over there. But
    you can’t just say “pick up that box and put it over there on the chair”. You have to tell me one instruction
    at a time, and the only things I understand are: step forward, turn right, pick up, and put down. You each get
    to take a turn giving me one instruction and see if all of the instructions you give me can make me pick up the
    box and put it on the chair. If you give me an instruction I don’t understand, or if something else goes wrong,
    I will say “DOES NOT COMPUTE!” and start over by returning to where I started!</p>

  <p>(play game. Maybe the adults give hints)</p>

  <p>Ok, now the box is on the chair and I’m going to stop pretending to be a robot. Let’s see what’s in the box!</p>

  <p><b>Another Following Instruction Game:</b></p>

  <p>(In the box is a pile of paper with numbered points on them in the shape of a pentagon, a hexagon,
    and an octogon, and a marker for each child) We’re going to do another game where we do something that
    computers can do: draw shapes. Today we are going to draw a few different kinds of stars. This is like
    a connect the dot, but instead of going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we’re going to listen to the instructions and draw
    the lines between the numbers in the instructions.</p>

  <p>Let’s start with the five points. Open your markers and follow these instructions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw a line from 1 to 3
    <li>Draw a line from 3 to 5
    <li>Draw a line from 5 to 2
    <li>Draw a line from 2 to 4
    <li>Draw a line from 4 to 1
  </ol>
  <p>What shape did we make? (a 5 pointed star!) We drew a star with 5 points by starting the line at one point,
    skipping a point, and drawing to the next point.</p>

  <p>Now the next shape:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw a line from 1 to 5
    <li>Draw a line from 5 to 3
    <li>Draw a line from 3 to 1
    <li>Draw a line from 2 to 6
    <li>Draw a line from 6 to 4
    <li>Draw a line from 4 to 2
  </ol>
  <p>What shape did we make? (a 6 pointed star!) We drew a star with 6 points by starting the line at one
    point, skipping 4 points! and drawing to the next point</p>

  <p>Now the last shape:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw a line from 1 to 5
    <li>Draw a line from 2 to 6
    <li>Draw a line from 3 to 7
    <li>Draw a line from 4 to 8
  </ol>
  <p>What shape did we make? (an asterisk! Which is an 8 pointed star that meets in the middle) We drew a star
    with 8 points by starting the line at one point, skipping 4 points, and drawing to the next point. That’s
    the same number we skipped when we drew the 6 pointed star, but look at how different the stars look!</p>

  <p><b>Now A Demo:</b></p>

  <p>Computers are very good at following instructions, so let’s take a look at a program I wrote that let’s
    you tell the computer any number of points in the star and any number of points to skip when drawing lines.
    (<a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html</a>)</p>

  <p>Here’s the 5 pointed star where we skipped 1:</p>
  <p><a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=5&increment=2">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=5&increment=2</a>
  </p>

  <p>Here’s the 6 pointed star where we skipped 4:</p>
  <p><a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=6&increment=4">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=6&increment=4</a>
  </p>

  <p>Here’s the 8 pointed star where we skipped 4:</p>
  <p><a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=8&increment=4">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=8&increment=4</a>
  </p>

  <p>The computer is so fast, we can have it draw more than one line for each point. Here’s what happens if
    we have it draw the 8 pointed star, but 4 lines from each point instead of just 1:</p>
  <p><a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=8&rays=4&increment=1">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=8&rays=4&increment=1</a>
  </p>

  <p>What if we wanted to draw a star with 100 points skipping up 43 points at a time?!:</p>
  <p><a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=100&increment=43">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=100&increment=43</a>
  </p>

  <p>What if we wanted to draw a star with 200 points, skipping up 99 points at a time and with 99 lines
    from each point???! The computer can do it easy!:</p>
  <p><a href="http://nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=200&increment=99&rays=99">nfolkert.github.io/toys/pages/star.html?points=200&increment=99&rays=99</a>
  </p>
  <p>But it has so many lines and so many points that to us it just looks like a circle!</p>

  <p><b>Project Time!</b></p>
  <p>Okay, enough about computers and stars. Now it’s time to build robots. But building a real robot is
    very hard, and programming the robot to do something is even harder -- it takes hundreds of grown ups
    to do that kind of thing! Instead we’re going to build a pretend robot. But so it is useful like a
    regular robot, we’re going to build a pretend robot that we can eat!</p>

  <p>(Get out “robot” materials: juice box body, apple sauce head, googly eyes, candy arms, raisin box feet.
    Every kid gets one juice box, one apple sauce, 2 candy arms, 2 raisin box feet, a spoon, and as many
    googly eyes as they want. We’ll bring double sided and single sided sticky tape to put together the body,
    but we’ll need a daub of glue or glue stick to hold on the googly eyes.)</p>
